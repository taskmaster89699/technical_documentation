                <li>Python is a high level language. It is an interpreted language, as Python programs are executed by
                    an interpreter. The
                    interpreter is also called Python shell.</li>
                <li>Python programs are easy to understand as
                    they have a clearly defined syntax and relatively
                    simple structure.</li>
                <li>Python is also helpful in web development. Many
                    popular web services and applications are built
                    using Python.</li>

                    <h3>Identifiers</h3>
                    In programming languages, identifiers are names used
                    to identify a variable, function, or other entities in a
                    program. The rules for naming an identifier in Python
                    are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name should begin with an uppercase or a
                            lowercase alphabet or an underscore sign (_). This
                            may be followed by any combination of characters
                            a–z, A–Z, 0–9 or underscore (_). Thus, an identifier
                            cannot start with a digit.</li>
                        <li>It can be of any length. (However, it is preferred to
                            keep it short and meaningful).</li>
                        <li>It should not be a keyword or reserved word given
                            in Table 5.1.</li>
                        <li>We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %,
                            etc., in identifiers.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="topic bc-1">
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <p>Variable in Python refers to an object — an
                        item or element that is stored in the memory. Value
                        of a variable can be a string (e.g., ‘b’, ‘Global Citizen’),
                        numeric (e.g., 345) or any combination of alphanumeric
                        characters (CD67). In Python we can use an assignment
                        statement to create new variables and assign specific
                        values to them.

                <h2>Flow of Control</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The order of execution of the statements in a program
                is known as flow of control. The flow of control can be
                implemented using control structures.

                <h4>If Else Statement</h4>
                In programming, this
                concept of decision making or
                selection is implemented with the
                help of if..else statement. The syntax of if statement is:</p>
                <div class="syntax bc-1">
                    <pre>
if condition:
 statement(s)
else:
 statement(s)</pre>

                        eligible to vote. If the condition is true, then the indented
                        statement(s) are executed. The indentation implies that
                        its execution is dependent on the condition.</p>

                <h4>For Loop</h4>
                <p>The for statement is used to iterate over a range of
                    values or a sequence. The for loop is executed for each
                    of the items in the range. With every iteration of the loop, the
                    control variable checks whether each
                    of the values in the range have been
                    traversed or not. When all the items in
                    the range are exhausted, the statements
                    within loop are not executed; the control
                    is then transferred to the statement

                <h4>While loop</h4>
                <p>The while statement executes a block of code repeatedly
                    as long as the control condition of the loop is true. The
                    control condition of the while
                    loop is executed before any
                    statement inside the loop is
                    executed. After each iteration,
                    the control condition is tested
                    again and the loop continues as
                    long as the condition remains
                    true. When this condition becomes
                    false, the statements in the body
                    of loop are not executed and the
                    control is transferred to the
                    statement immediately following
                    the body of while loop. If the
                    condition of the while loop is
                    initially false, the body is not

                    an infinite loop, leading to a logical error in the program.

                <h3>Functions</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Function
                can be defined as a named group of instructions that
                accomplish a specific task when it is invoked. Once
                defined, a function can be called repeatedly from
                different places of the program without writing all the
                codes of that function everytime, or it can be called from
                inside another function, by simply writing the name of
                the function and passing the required parameters, if
                any.</p>
            <h5>The Advantages of Function</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases readability, particularly for longer code
                    as by using functions, the program is better
                    organised and easy to understand.</li>
                <li>Reduces code length as same code is not required
                    to be written at multiple places in a program. This
                    also makes debugging easier.</li>
                <li>Increases reusability, as function can be called from
                    another function or another program. Thus, we can
                    reuse or build upon already defined functions and
                    avoid repetitions of writing the same piece of code</li>
                <li>Work can be easily divided among team members
                    and completed in parallel. </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="syntax bc-1">
                The syntax of Function is as follows:

            <p>String is a sequence which is made up of one or more
                UNICODE characters. Here the character can be a letter,
                digit, whitespace or any other symbol. A string can be
                created by enclosing one or more characters in single,
                double or triple quote.</p>

                <h3>String Operations</h3>
                <p>As we know that string is a sequence of characters.
                    Python allows certain operations on string data type,
                    such as concatenation, repetition, membership and
                    slicing. These operations are explained in the following
                    subsections with suitable examples</p>
                <section class="sub-topic bc-1">
                    <h4>Concatenation</h4>
                    <p>To concatenate means to join. Python allows us to join
                        two strings using concatenation operator plus which is
                        denoted by symbol +.</p>

                    <div class="example bc-1">
                        <pre>
                        <code>
>>> str1 = 'Hello' #First string
>>> str2 = 'World!' #Second string
>>> str1 + str2 #Concatenated strings
'HelloWorld!'
</code>
</pre>
                    </div>
                </section>
                <section class="sub-topic bc-1">
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>Python allows us to repeat the given string using
                        repetition operator which is denoted by symbol *.</p>

                    <div class="example bc-1">
                        <pre><code>
#assign string 'Hello' to str1
>>> str1 = 'Hello' 
#repeat the value of str1 2 times
>>> str1 * 2 
'HelloHello'
#repeat the value of str1 5 times
>>> str1 * 5 
'HelloHelloHelloHelloHello'
</code>
</pre>

                <section class="bc-1">
                    <h4>Membership</h4>
                    <p>Python has two membership operators 'in' and 'not
                        in'. The 'in' operator takes two strings and returns
                        True if the first string appears as a substring in the
                        second string, otherwise it returns False.</p>

                    <div class="example bc-1">
                        <pre><code>
>>> str1 = 'Hello World!'
>>> 'W' in str1
True
>>> 'Wor' in str1
True
>>> 'My' in str1
False
</code>
</pre>
                        <p>The 'not in' operator also takes two strings and
                            returns True if the first string does not appear as a
                            substring in the second string, otherwise returns False.</p>
                        <pre>
                        <code>
>>> str1 = 'Hello World!'
>>> 'My' not in str1 
True
>>> 'Hello' not in str1
False

                    <h4>Slicing</h4>
                    <p>In Python, to access some part of a string or substring,
                        we use a method called slicing. This can be done by specifying an index range. Given a string
                        str1, the
                        slice operation str1[n:m] returns the part of the string
                        str1 starting from index n (inclusive) and ending at m
                        (exclusive). In other words, we can say that str1[n:m]
                        returns all the characters starting from str1[n] till
                        str1[m-1]. The numbers of characters in the substring
                        will always be equal to difference of two indices m and
                        n, i.e., (m-n).</p>
